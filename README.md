Robust Analysis of Semi-automated Segmentation Algorithms:

Working with difficult segmentation problems such as some of the problems above motivates the use of semiautomatic segmentation algorithms.  We are particularly interested in algorithms where there is an interactive phase where an operator enters some high-level contextual information which is followed by a fully automatic phase.  Most evaluations of such algorithms are performed by having a small number of human operators segment each image once, or just a few times.  This limits the number of interactive inputs that are encountered by the algorithm, and therefore the confidence and accuracy of the evaluation.   We are investigating methods of overcoming these difficulties.  We are also interested in rigorously evaluating the relationships between segmentation accuracy, precision (reproducibility), and operator time and the method by which contextual information is input (efficiency).
